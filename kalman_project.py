# Kalman Filter

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

'''
1. We must simulate a ground truth 2D trajectory and noiosy position measurements
2. Derive and implement a discrete kalman filter for a constant velocity
3. Evaluate accuracy versus a baseline (like a moving average using RMSE)
4. Validate statistical assumptions using innovation or residual tests
5. Stretch to handle missing measurements and occasional outliers robustly
